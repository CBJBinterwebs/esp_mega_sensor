# esp_mega_sensor
<p>Code for air monitoring sensor with web server.  Basically, it will take data from the three sensors and present some of the information on the OLED screen, as well as presenting that plus additional information in a responsive webpage.  Initially started this project 'for fun' during major forest fires in the Pacific Northwest to monitor the air quality in my child's nursery.</p>

This project requires:
<ul>
  <li>an Espressif MCU device such as ESP-8266, Wemos D1, etc.</li>
  <li>DHT11 sensor</li>
  <li>BMP180 sensor</li>
  <li>SGP30 sensor</li>
  <li>SSD1306 OLED screen</li>
  <li>a 'neopixel' LED</li>
  <li>a PCB or breadboard to mount it all</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>This project likely requires soldering.  Please, be careful and do so at your own risk.</p>
